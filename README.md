# plagiarism-analyzer-and-detector
This project is a Flask-powered web application designed to detect plagiarism in textual documents. It allows users to upload .txt, .pdf, or .docx files or directly input text, and compares the content against a local database of documents. The system employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniquesâ€”such as tokenization, lemmatization.
